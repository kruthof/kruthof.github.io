I am a Data Scientist with a background in `Machine Learning and Finance`. I am interested in research at the intersection of these two disciplines, which involves the development, evaluation and implementation of machine learning techniques for `financial market research`. Currently, I am studying the question how `deep reinforcement learning` approaches can help us to provide new insights into `investor behaviour`. 

I am also involved into `open source software development` aiming to provide tools that help us to improve the way we conduct finance research. I have studied Data Analytics (MSc.) at the University College Dublin and Banking & Finance (M.A.) at the University of St.Gallen.
