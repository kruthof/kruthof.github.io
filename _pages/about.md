I am a senior lecturer and researcher with a background in `Machine Learning and Financial Markets`. I am interested in research at the intersection of these two disciplines. Thereby, I want to understand 1) how we can utilize modern AI technology to tackle the major problems of our time and 2) what are the implications of AI for our societies. My current projects include: 

* Utilisation of machine learning in the context of `climate finance`.
* Investigating implied knowledge within `large language models`
* Understanding the `implications of AI technology` on social welfare 

I am also involved into `open source software development` aiming to provide tools that help us to improve the way we conduct research at the intersection of economics and machine learning. I have studied Data Analytics (MSc.) at the University College Dublin and Banking & Finance (M.A.) at the University of St.Gallen.
