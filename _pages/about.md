I am a Data Scientist with a background in `Machine Learning and Finance`. I am interested in research at the intersection of these two disciplines, which involves the development, evaluation and implementation of machine learning techniques for `financial market research`. My current projects include: 
* Application of `deep reinforcement learning` approaches to portfolio management and its capacity to provide new insights into `investor behaviour`. 
* Utilisation of remote sensoring in the context of `climate finance`. 

I am also involved into `open source software development` aiming to provide tools that help us to improve the way we conduct research at the intersection of finance and machine learning. I have studied Data Analytics (MSc.) at the University College Dublin and Banking & Finance (M.A.) at the University of St.Gallen.
