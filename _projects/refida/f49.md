# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
toc:
  - name: Overview
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
  - name: Features
  - name: Data Processing
  - name: Usage

## Overview

The dataset is based on the [49 industry portfolios data](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_49_ind_port.html) published by Kenneth R. French using equally weighting method. The original data features missing values until around 1969. This time episode is excluded, resulting in a time window between 1969 - 2021. Preprocessing generates various technical indicators for each portfolio and changes the shape of the data frame, to make it more confinient for subsequent modeling tasks.
